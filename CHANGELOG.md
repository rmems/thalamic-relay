## [Unreleased]

- **Outbound sensory queue (RM-1329):** `IsolatedPublishQueue` is a validated finite buffer (`--sensory-queue-capacity` / `THALAMIC_SENSORY_QUEUE_CAPACITY`, default 32, range 1–4096) with an explicit full-queue policy (`--sensory-queue-full-policy` / `THALAMIC_SENSORY_QUEUE_FULL_POLICY`, default `drop-oldest`, also `reject-newest`). Prometheus exposes `sensory_queue_depth`, `sensory_queue_capacity`, `sensory_queue_enqueued_total`, `sensory_queue_dropped_total{reason}` (closed label set), and `sensory_queue_full_policy{policy}`. `CorpusIpcPublisher` enqueues into this buffer from a detached UDP worker. Safety evaluation is unchanged and does not wait on the consumer.
- **Docs/CI (GH#25 / RM-1215):** Documented Rust 2024 edition separately from MSRV `1.98.1`. `package.rust-version` is the authoritative pin; CI installs that exact string and asserts `rustc` plus `rust-toolchain.toml` match it. The dtolnay/rust-toolchain SHA is an action pin, not a rustc version.
- **Orderly shutdown and leftover-brake restart (GH#51 / RM-1225):** SIGINT/SIGTERM leave the run loop through a controlled path that joins metrics collection and in-flight actuation with a bounded timeout and releases the process lock. Shutdown never dispatches a new power-limit restore: an unresolved critical/unverified/recovering brake stays engaged. Restart classifies current vs default PL so a relay-owned 50% leftover is adopted (and released only after the normal Ok streak) while an operator-configured sub-default cap is left untouched. Simulated telemetry cannot authorize release of a real persistent brake. See `docs/safety.md`.
- **corpus-ipc sensory publish (GH#40 / RM-1144):** Production maps the GH#41 `SensoryMapping` into published `corpus-ipc` 0.1.0 `StimulusBatch` / `IpcMessage::Stimuli` and UDP-publishes it from a detached worker (`CorpusIpcPublisher`). Safety evaluation stays isolated: send failures, disconnects, slow consumers, and Brainstem absence cannot stall `SafetyMachine::evaluate`. `--ipc-endpoint` / `--ipc-disabled` / `--ipc-session-id` configure the fire-and-forget path. See `docs/ipc.md`.
- **CI (GH#50 / RM-1224):** Every `main`/PR run now qualifies crates.io packaging: exact declared MSRV, `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --all-features`, `cargo package --locked`, a smoke test of the packed `.crate` outside the repository, and `cargo publish --dry-run --locked`. Real `cargo publish` is not automated.
- **Public library surface (GH#45):** `thalamic_relay` now exposes purpose-based modules (`telemetry`, `safety`, `publish`) as the reusable API. NVML/`nvidia-smi` backends, Prometheus initialization, CLI/process-lock plumbing, and the supervisor loop are private to the `thalamic-relay` executable. Crate-level rustdoc includes a GPU-less usage example; `#![deny(missing_docs)]` covers the public surface; `tests/library_surface.rs` compiles the consumer API.
- **Packaging (GH#48):** Completes crates.io package metadata (`readme`, keywords, categories, homepage, documentation) and an explicit `include` allowlist so contributor/agent files, CI, and local tool configs are not shipped in the `.crate`. Dual MIT/Apache-2.0 license files remain in the package.
- **Time / freshness (RM-1335):** Process-local `SampleClock` stamps every emitted frame with a stable `session_id` (new on restart) and a strictly increasing `batch_id` (corpus-ipc `StimulusBatch` field names). Source wall time is preserved separately from receive/emit time with `timestamp_origin` / `source_time_status`. Duplicate, backward, missing, and very large source timestamps do not regress the sample sequence. Freshness (`telemetry_freshness_s`) uses receive-time `Instant`, not source wall time. CSV/replay rows share the same clock as live collectors.
- **Hardware telemetry CSV contract (RM-629 / corinth-canal#160):** One-way copy of the frozen five-column header and reader/validator semantics (`header mismatch` fails closed; short / non-numeric / non-finite rows are skipped; replay wraps and rewrites `timestamp_ms` to `tick + 1`). Hosted in `thalamic_relay::telemetry_csv` and `docs/telemetry_csv.md` so producers can validate before corinth ingest. No dependency in either direction; corinth's env-truth surface is not copied. Schema frozen: `timestamp_ms,gpu_temp_c,gpu_power_w,cpu_tctl_c,cpu_package_power_w`.
- **Test (RM-1217 / GH#27):** Closed remaining software-only coverage gaps after GH#39: telemetry validation/normalization edge cases, deterministic `SafetyMachine` warn/critical/brake/recovery (including invalid/stale/missing/simulated samples and actuator failure), CLI/lockfile regressions, a GPU-less integration harness, and IPC isolation tests proving `AbsentPublisher` / failing / slow / disconnected sinks cannot stall safety-loop progress. Typed `corpus-ipc` round-trips remain blocked on GH#40 / RM-1144.
- **Safety actuation boundary (GH#46):** Extracted privileged GPU actuation behind a `SafetyActuator` trait in `safety`, complementing the pure `SafetyMachine` policy (GH#42). The NVML/`nvidia-smi` backend is now `NvmlActuator` in `gpu` — a hardware adapter that implements the trait but defines no safety semantics. Actuator failures are typed and observable (`ActuatorError`) instead of stringly coupled to the supervisor, startup brake detection returns a typed `BrakeMatch`, and an in-memory `FakeActuator` enables deterministic apply/release tests with no GPU or subprocess. The supervisor drives actuation through `Arc<dyn SafetyActuator>`, preserving fail-closed behavior.
- **Breaking (internal):** Replaced numeric `GpuTelemetry` fields with a typed `TelemetrySample` contract (`Option` values, explicit source/validity/unit/freshness). Software-only mode is tagged `TelemetrySource::SoftwareFallback` and is no longer inferred from `temperature <= 0 && power <= 25`. Missing sensors stay `None` instead of silent `0.0`/`NaN`. See `docs/telemetry.md` (GH#41)
- Added `TelemetryFrame::to_sensory_mapping()` as the deterministic mapping surface toward corpus-ipc (transport remains GH#40)
- NVML/driver failure is `TelemetrySource::NvmlUnavailable` (fail closed); `SoftwareFallback` is reserved for `--force-software-only`. Mapping re-evaluates freshness at emit time and carries stale threshold plus configured `--step-interval-ms` cadence. Freshness gauge is computed at scrape time from a monotonic receive `Instant` (RM-1335), not source wall time.
- **Safety failure domain (GH#42):** `SafetyMachine` is isolated from IPC/Brainstem. Named states (healthy-real, warning, critical/braked, recovering, telemetry missing/stale/invalid, simulated, actuator-failure), documented hysteresis, Prometheus safety/brake/transition/actuator-failure metrics, and GPU-less tests including a failing/slow publish sink. See `docs/safety.md`.
- **Breaking:** Removed in-process SNN execution (`neuromod::SpikingNetwork`, `NeuroModulators`) and the UDP control surface it existed to drive (`Stimuli` / `LearningReward` / `GetNeuroState`, and the `--udp-addr`/`--num-channels`/`--num-lif`/`--num-izh` flags). Thalamic is now a sensory + deterministic hardware-safety relay only; neural execution lives in `brainstem-daemon`. `docs/ipc.md` now documents the removal and points to the planned `corpus-ipc`-based replacement (RM-1143 / GH#39)
- Removed the `neuromod` and `serde_json` dependencies (no longer used)
- Bumped MSRV from `1.97.1` to `1.98.1`
